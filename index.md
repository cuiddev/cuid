## CUID - Cryptocurrency Unique Identifier Standard
A new data field standard for cryptocurrency related API communications. We are trying to solve the Name/Ticker conflict of cryptocurrencies.

### What are we trying to do?
We encourage exchanges, cryptocurrency info services to add 'cuid' data field on their API. 'cuid' is a pre-defined ID for each Cryptocurrency stored in an Ethererum Smart Contract.

### How can we find 'cuid' of a Coin/Token?
Go to cuid.services webpage and search for name/ticker. Or directly create a script that reads 0x.. smart contract event logs.

### How is cuid of a Coin/Token defined?
We define cuid of popular coins/tokens on start and continue to update the list. Also, you can send us a request to add a token/coin via filling cuid.services/add form. Editors check the information you provided and call smart contract.
